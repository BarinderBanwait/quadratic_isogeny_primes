# Quadratic Isogeny Primes

This is the repository for the program **Quadratic Isogeny Primes**, whose algorithms are explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/).

### What does it do?

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

### How do I use it?

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

### Wasn't there also some Magma and PARI/GP code?

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

### I found a bug, what do I do now?

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line

### Why only quadratic fields? I want isogeny primes over number fields of degree 29.

Well I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait dear visitor! Even extending the algorithms to cover degree 3 is beyond current technology. One question that needs to be addressed is extending Momose's P_(n) constants; this is related to when the nth Symmetric power of X_0(N) is a formal immersion at infinity. Work that out, and we might be in business!

### Where can I learn more about elliptic curves and other cool stuff?

You can head over to the [L-functions and Modular Forms Database](https://lmfdb.org/), there you'll find loads of resources, data, and proper cool images.
